## Week 6

In the sixth week, the focus was on debugging issues in multi-coil navigation and improving support for secondary robot registration. The key activities included:

- Debug Mode in Simultaneous Navigation
    - Identified a limitation where the debugger worked only for one coil — specifically the first and the last selected target.
    - Began adjustments to extend debugging functionality across all coils in simultaneous navigation mode.

- Multitarget Coil Display
    - Noted an issue where coils in multitarget mode only appeared after opening Preferences.
    - Investigated the display logic to ensure coils are correctly listed without requiring additional steps.

- Secondary Robot Base Registration
    - Confirmed that base registration occurs for two robots, but only one is being fully recognized.
    - Observed dependency on coil_1 with robot_1 for proper registration, requiring refinement to support multiple robot–coil pairs consistently.
