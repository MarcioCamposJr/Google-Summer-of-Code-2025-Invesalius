## Week 13

In the thirteenth week, the focus was on improving collision handling between coils through PID adjustments. The main activities included:

- PID Tuning for Coil Collision
    - Implemented a PID adjustment model to manage and prevent collisions between coils.
    - Evaluated parameters to ensure smooth and safe coil movements during navigation.
